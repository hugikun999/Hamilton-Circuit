# Hamilton-Circuit
This a simple program to find a Hamilton-circuit in a given diagram. 

# Step to Run the program
### Modify the size of diagram
The program needs to modify the size of diagram which will be input to the program in advance.Modify the number of ***#define V 5*** at line 3 to the size you want.That is how much point in your diagram.

### compile the program
use C++ compiler to compiler the program.
### Input the data
[example diagram](http://s3.amazonaws.com/answer-board-image/121c87db-81ea-4ee0-b2f8-17240ed6a445.png)

Like the example diagram, you need to input the number if there is a road between any two points.After you finishes all the roads in the diagram, you need to input ***0 0*** to complete the data input.If there exists any Hamilton-Circuit,program will print out the cycle.
